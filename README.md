# Frontend and Backend Service with Hot Reload

This project is designed to demonstrate a full-stack development setup using **React** (frontend) and **Express.js** (backend) with **TypeScript**. The frontend utilizes **Vite** for fast development with hot-reloading capabilities. Both frontend and backend are containerized using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**, making the application easy to deploy and manage.

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main parts:

- **Frontend**: A React app built using Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS, and supporting hot reloading for rapid development.
- **Backend**: An API built with Express.js and TypeScript, providing a simple REST API for the frontend to consume.

Both services are containerized with Docker, enabling easy local development and deployment.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:

  - **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Vite**: Next-generation build tool for fast development with HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for efficient styling.

- **Backend**:

  - **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the API.
  - **Express.js**: Web framework for building REST APIs.
  - **TypeScript**: Adds static typing for JavaScript, improving the developer experience and catching bugs earlier.

- **Docker**: Used to containerize the frontend and backend services.
- **Docker Compose**: Used to manage multi-container applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ssaavedraa/technical-test.git
   cd technical-test
   ```

2. **Build and start the containers**:

   Use the following command to build and start both the frontend and backend services:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

3. **Access the application**:

   - Frontend (React + Vite): [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
   - Backend (Express API): [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

4. **Hot Reload**:
   - The frontend will automatically reload when you make changes to the `client/src` directory, thanks to Vite's HMR support.

## Configuration

### Vite (Frontend) Configuration

The Vite development server is configured to listen on `0.0.0.0` (to make it accessible inside Docker), and it uses polling for file watching inside Docker containers.

#### **`vite.config.ts`**:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
	server: {
		host: '0.0.0.0', // Ensures it listens on all interfaces in Docker
		hmr: {
			host: 'localhost', // This will make sure HMR is enabled on localhost
		},
		watch: {
			usePolling: true, // For file system watching inside Docker
		},
	},
});
```

### Docker Configuration

- **Frontend Dockerfile** (`client/Dockerfile`): Sets up the Vite server in a lightweight Node.js environment.
- **Backend Dockerfile** (`api/Dockerfile`): Builds the Express API using Node.js.
- **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.yml`): Defines both services (frontend and backend), with correct port mappings and dependencies.

### Docker Compose Configuration

- **`docker-compose.yml`** defines two services:
  - `frontend`: React app served using Vite, with live reloading.
  - `api`: Express API that provides endpoints for the frontend.

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Start the development environment**:

   - Run `docker-compose up --build` to start both services.

2. **Edit the frontend code**:

   - Changes made in the `client/src` directory will trigger Vite's hot-reload mechanism, automatically refreshing the browser.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Hot Reload Not Working**:
  - Ensure the correct port mappings are set up (5173 for frontend, 5000 for backend).
  - Check the logs of the frontend container using `docker compose logs frontend-service` for any issues.
- **Port Conflicts**:
  - If port `5173` or `5000` is already in use, change the ports in `docker-compose.yml` to avoid conflicts.

## Requirements

As part of this technical test for a Frontend Developer position, you are expected to implement the following features and complete the associated questions within **4 hours**.

### Frontend Implementation

1. **UI/UX Design**:

   - Use **React** and **Tailwind CSS** to design a user-friendly interface that visualizes a **JSON object**. This visualization should display each key-value pair in the object as separate blocks with connections (edges) between nested keys.
   - Use **React Flow** to visualize the hierarchical structure of the JSON object. Each nested object should be represented as a separate node, and array values should be displayed in individual blocks.

2. **Responsiveness**:

   - Ensure the application is responsive and adapts well to various screen sizes.

3. **Interactivity**:

   - Implement the following interactive features:
     - **Hover Effects**: Highlight nodes and edges when hovering over them to show relationships or additional details.
     - **Node Expansion**: Allow users to click on a node to expand or collapse nested objects and arrays.
     - **Tooltips/Info Boxes**: Show tooltips or info boxes that display extra details about a node when users hover or click on it.

4. **Performance**:

   - Ensure the app remains performant when handling large JSON structures with many nodes and edges. Consider optimizations for rendering and data handling.

5. **API Integration**:

   - Fetch JSON data from the **Express API** (already set up) and dynamically render it on the frontend.

6. **Bug to Solve**:
   - There is a hidden bug in the **API** that must be solved on the **frontend** side. The bug may cause unexpected behavior in the data visualization. As part of the test, you should identify and resolve this issue within the frontend code.

### Questions to Answer

1. **How did you approach the development of the frontend visualization?**  
   Describe how you managed the complexity of rendering dynamic JSON data and ensuring the user interface is clear and efficient. What libraries or techniques did you use to make this process scalable?

2. **What challenges did you face during the development process, and how did you overcome them?**  
   Discuss any obstacles you encountered while working with React, React Flow, Tailwind CSS, or the API integration, and explain how you solved them.

3. **How did you ensure that your solution can scale with larger datasets?**  
   What steps did you take to ensure the application remains performant and manageable as the size of the JSON data grows? Did you consider optimizations such as lazy loading, memoization, or virtualized rendering?

4. **What strategies did you implement to enhance interactivity and the user experience?**  
   How did you make the visualization interactive, and what user interface patterns or features did you use to improve the overall user experience?

5. **How would you improve the app’s scalability and performance for future updates or features?**  
   If this project were to evolve or handle even larger and more complex datasets, how would you approach enhancing its scalability and performance?

6. **How did you identify and resolve the hidden bug in the API on the frontend side?**  
   Describe the process you used to identify the bug, how it impacted the data visualization, and how you fixed it within the frontend code.
